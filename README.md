If you want add all previous hours in easy way this section is made for you!

You can import your hours in simple way with a csv file (like excel).

The columns in the file must be like the exportation (click Export hours in CSV to show an example).

Be careful : the importation will be delete all your data inserted previously.

# Export hours inserted in chrome extension

Like the importation, this menu voice permits to download in easy way all your data inserted.

The format is the same as the import file, so you can use this voice for backup the data.

# Light/Dark Mode 
Simple button that permits to choose to have a light or dark interface, I hope you like it! :) 

# Some idea to develop in the future 
Until I have the time I would like to improve this chrome extension.

I like to : 
- add more filters to statistics, like show past years or make more useful graphs 
- implements some partial exportation 
- backup online with google drive or dropbox
